    ℹ️ Information ℹ️
  </h3>
  <br>
  <span> An application of a table with the Star Wars planets with a complex filter system using the forms, being able to filter only the row you want using the search and filters. </span> 
  <br><br>
  <span> Instead of using React, this time we used the Context API for communication between components, helping a lot to transcribe data and filters between components in the project. </span>
